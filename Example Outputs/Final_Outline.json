It will articulate the research hypothesis that China\u2019s grand strategy is shifting towards assertive power projection through economic and military means, particularly via the BRI and military modernization efforts. The narrative will incorporate a historical perspective on China's 'peaceful rise', counterbalanced by national rejuvenation ideals and responses to U.S. containment strategies.
